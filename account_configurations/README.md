This folder is used to hold account configuration files.
Each account has their own configuration file, where hashtags and quotes can be inserted.
Also, account name, page identifier and Instagram user id will be stored here to reduce API call traffic.

These files can be created automatically by calling the application with the flag -a.
After the files are created, you can insert your own custom hashtags and captions to the arrays.s
